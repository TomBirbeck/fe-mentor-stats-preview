## My process

Intially I applied a small CSS reset to the page. I then added the requird fonts and created a css file where I added custom CSS variables.\
I then built out the html frame for the component with class names for the elements.\
I styled the mobile view first before moving on to the desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

On this project I learned about mixed-blend-mode and how it can be used to add effects to your images.

### Useful resources

- [MDN-mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
